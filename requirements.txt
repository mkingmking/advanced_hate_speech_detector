# --- Optimization for CPU-only environments ---
# Install PyTorch CPU-only. This is CRUCIAL for reducing image size and build time.
# We explicitly specify the index URL for CPU-only wheels.
# You might need to specify a exact version like torch==2.x.y+cpu
# Check the PyTorch website for the latest stable CPU-only installation command:
# https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
# As of current information, it often looks like:
# torch @ https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch-2.4.0%2Bcpu-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl # Example (adjust version as needed)
# Or, the preferred method is to add the --extra-index-url in your Dockerfile pip install command
# rather than hardcoding the URL here, as it makes version management easier.
# So, we'll keep 'torch' here, but modify the Dockerfile's pip command.
torch

# Transformers will automatically detect the CPU-only PyTorch and install its CPU-only dependencies.
